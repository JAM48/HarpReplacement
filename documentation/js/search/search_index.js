When you visit  our Site, you will be requested to complete provide certain information that  our business affiliates request in order to perform a preliminary analysis of  your qualifications to receive the service or products. Based upon your  consent, as evidenced by your registering with us on this Site (i.e., your  submission of the requested information on the application), we will forward  the information that you provided to certain of our business affiliates.\n      In  addition, from time to time, we or our business affiliates may provide you the  additional service (the \"Premium Service\") of sending you e-mail you  or otherwise corresponding with you to inform you of additional opportunities  to receive special offers for other services and/or products that we believe may  be of interest. There are no fees for Premium Service, and you are under no  obligation to accept any service or product with any of our business affiliates  offered under the Premium Service.\n      \n      Information We Collect\n      The  information that we collect is generally limited to personal information about  you that our business affiliates consider necessary for performing a  preliminary evaluation of your qualifications. To the extent that you can order  products, enter contests, express an opinion, or subscribe to a service(s), the  type of personally identifiable information that may be collected may include:  name; address; e-mail address; telephone number; fax number; credit card  information; information about your interests in and use of various products,  programs, and services; education level; educational interests; home owner  status; income; debt level; current mortgage; mortgage rate and the like. To  the extent that you are requested and you do submit information about other  people, such information will be limited recipient's name, address, e-mail  address, and telephone number.\n      We  also collect user information that can help us optimize and enhance your  experience on our Site; as well as provide you with an efficient, safe, smooth,  and customized experience. For example, if you came to this Site from an online  banner ad, pop-up or other advertisement, an anonymous identification number  may be passed to our Site. In some cases, we may place a cookie in your  browser. The aforementioned information cannot, by itself, be used to gather  any personally identifiable information about you, but it will allow us to  track the overall effectiveness of our online advertising campaigns. We also  automatically track certain information with respect to your behavior on the  Site through the forgoing cookie or identification number. This non personally  identifiable information may include the Internet address or URL that you just  came from and which URL you go to next; your computer browser information; and  your IP address. We use this non personally identifiable information in  conjunction with some of the information that you provided to us to do internal  research on our users' demographics and behavior; and to better understand how  to best serve other users of this Site. Third parties may also set cookies on  our sites to determine proper site usage and click count.\n      We  also utilize Web Logs to track aggregate information about how our site is  being used. Web Logs track anonymous user information, including but not  limited to the number of visitors to our site, operating systems and browser  type. Unlike cookies, Web Logs are maintained only on our servers and do not  store or place anything on the user's computer.\n      \n      How We Use Your Information\n      We  collect the information that you submit and which our business affiliates  consider necessary for performing a preliminary evaluation of your  qualifications for their products and services. Prior to sending your  information to our business affiliates, we attempt to validate it. For example,  we may compare and review your personal information for errors, omissions, and  accuracy based upon past usage and response; or compare your information  against other publicly available files; or validate some of the personal  information submitted to verify that the information inputted has a high  probability of being valid information.\n      After  we submit your information to our business affiliates, our business affiliates  may begin a separate and independent evaluation of the information you  submitted (the \"Preliminary Application\"). If our business affiliates  find that the Preliminary Application meets with their more specific acceptance  criterion, they may contact you directly by phone, mail or e-mail. For more  information on how our business affiliates will handle your personal  information, please visit our business affiliate's website, and review their  privacy policy.

To the extent that you can order  products, enter contests, express an opinion, or subscribe to a service(s), the  type of personally identifiable information that may be collected may include:  name; address; e-mail address; telephone number; fax number; credit card  information; information about your interests in and use of various products,  programs, and services; education level; educational interests; home owner  status; income; debt level; current mortgage; mortgage rate and the like. To  the extent that you are requested and you do submit information about other  people, such information will be limited recipient\\'s name, address, e-mail  address, and telephone number.      We  also collect user information that can help us optimize and enhance your  experience on our Site; as well as provide you with an efficient, safe, smooth,  and customized experience. For example, if you came to this Site from an online  banner ad, pop-up or other advertisement, an anonymous identification number  may be passed to our Site. In some cases, we may place a cookie in your  browser. The aforementioned information cannot, by itself, be used to gather  any personally identifiable information about you, but it will allow us to  track the overall effectiveness of our online advertising campaigns. We also  automatically track certain information with respect to your behavior on the  Site through the forgoing cookie or identification number. This non personally  identifiable information may include the Internet address or URL that you just  came from and which URL you go to next; your computer browser information; and  your IP address. We use this non personally identifiable information in  conjunction with some of the information that you provided to us to do internal  research on our users\\' demographics and behavior; and to better understand how  to best serve other users of this Site. Third parties may also set cookies on  our sites to determine proper site usage and click count.      We  also utilize Web Logs to track aggregate information about how our site is  being used. Web Logs track anonymous user information, including but not  limited to the number of visitors to our site, operating systems and browser  type. Unlike cookies, Web Logs are maintained only on our servers and do not  store or place anything on the user\\'s computer.            How We Use Your Information      We  collect the information that you submit and which our business affiliates  consider necessary for performing a preliminary evaluation of your  qualifications for their products and services. Prior to sending your  information to our business affiliates, we attempt to validate it. For example,  we may compare and review your personal information for errors, omissions, and  accuracy based upon past usage and response; or compare your information  against other publicly available files; or validate some of the personal  information submitted to verify that the information inputted has a high  probability of being valid information.      After  we submit your information to our business affiliates, our business affiliates  may begin a separate and independent evaluation of the information you  submitted (the \"Preliminary Application\"). If our business affiliates  find that the Preliminary Application meets with their more specific acceptance  criterion, they may contact you directly by phone, mail or e-mail. For more  information on how our business affiliates will handle your personal  information, please visit our business affiliate\\'s website, and review their  privacy policy.
