      &lt;p&gt;We  are an on-line consumer service that introduces persons such as yourself to  certain of our business affiliates who have expressed a general willingness to  review your information and determine if they are willing to provide you with  the services or products that prompted you to visit our Site. When you visit  our Site, you will be requested to complete provide certain information that  our business affiliates request in order to perform a preliminary analysis of  your qualifications to receive the service or products. Based upon your  consent, as evidenced by your registering with us on this Site (i.e., your  submission of the requested information on the application), we will forward  the information that you provided to certain of our business affiliates.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;In  addition, from time to time, we or our business affiliates may provide you the  additional service (the &quot;Premium Service&quot;) of sending you e-mail you  or otherwise corresponding with you to inform you of additional opportunities  to receive special offers for other services and/or products that we believe may  be of interest. There are no fees for Premium Service, and you are under no  obligation to accept any service or product with any of our business affiliates  offered under the Premium Service.&lt;/p&gt;
      
      &lt;h4&gt;Information We Collect&lt;/h4&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;The  information that we collect is generally limited to personal information about  you that our business affiliates consider necessary for performing a  preliminary evaluation of your qualifications. To the extent that you can order  products, enter contests, express an opinion, or subscribe to a service(s), the  type of personally identifiable information that may be collected may include:  name; address; e-mail address; telephone number; fax number; credit card  information; information about your interests in and use of various products,  programs, and services; education level; educational interests; home owner  status; income; debt level; current mortgage; mortgage rate and the like.

In some cases, we may place a cookie in your  browser. The aforementioned information cannot, by itself, be used to gather  any personally identifiable information about you, but it will allow us to  track the overall effectiveness of our online advertising campaigns. We also  automatically track certain information with respect to your behavior on the  Site through the forgoing cookie or identification number. This non personally  identifiable information may include the Internet address or URL that you just  came from and which URL you go to next; your computer browser information; and  your IP address.
